# Operating-Systems-Class-Project
Development of Operating Systems Kernel on Kinetics K70 Hardware

# Abstract
This is an embedded operating systems development project that I worked on during my coursework at the Harvard Extension School. We used TWR-K70F120M ARM processor-based module to develop an operating system using C-programming language. We studied the following concepts and developed our own operating system from scratch. 

- Shell development
- Memory management
- Device drivers and peripherals
- File system and operations
- Process control and task scheduling
- Multi-threading
- Interrupt handling
- Morse-code transmission using LEDs and Interrupt Service Routines (ISR)
